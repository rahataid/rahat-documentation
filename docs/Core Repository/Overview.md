# Overview

## Purpose and Structure

The core repository serves as the foundational codebase for managing and deploying multiple projects within a single, cohesive environment. It is designed to facilitate modular development, allowing teams to work on isolated components while ensuring seamless integration. The structure is organized to support scalability, maintainability, and ease of collaboration. It typically includes multiple directories for applications, libraries, tools, and configuration files, all managed through a monorepo approach to streamline development processes.
