# Beneficiary Management

The **Beneficiary Management Tool** serves as a beneficiary management solution, aiming to streamline the effective and well-organized administration of individuals or communities benefiting from aid, support, or services. Beneficiary data is systematically collected, focusing on four primary criteria: **geographical**, **social**, **economic**, and **physical** indicators. This information is acquired through either primary means, utilizing the **Kobo Tool**, or secondary methods involving **municipality data**.

Upon data collection, the information is transferred to the Beneficiary Management Tool, where it undergoes a validation process against predefined criteria for each field. Any unvalidated data is automatically filtered out, providing users with a clean dataset. Users are granted the flexibility to **view**, **edit**, or **delete** data as necessary.

Furthermore, the tool offers filtering options that allow users to specifically target beneficiaries in the list based on **geographical**, **social**, **economic**, and **physical** indicators. The exported data can be saved either as an **Excel sheet** or directly to the **Rahat Dashboard**. 

> It is crucial to emphasize that the exported data strictly comprises **non-PII** (Personally Identifiable Information), ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection standards.
