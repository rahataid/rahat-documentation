# Purpose and Structure

The **Rahat Platform** is a comprehensive, open-source financial access platform designed to deliver **cash voucher assistance (CVA)** through blockchain-based tokens. Built with the aim of revolutionizing humanitarian aid distribution, Rahat ensures **efficient, transparent, and secure** fund transfers between humanitarian organizations, beneficiaries, and financial service providers.

At its core, Rahat functions as a **central codebase** that enables the **management, development, and deployment** of various projects within a **unified ecosystem**. The platform embraces a **modular architecture**, empowering independent projects and teams to work on isolated components without interfering with other areas. This approach fosters smooth collaboration, **faster iteration**, and **scalable development**.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized in a way that prioritizes **scalability, maintainability**, and **developer efficiency**, following a monorepo structure. Key components include:

### Applications
Contains different Rahat-related apps and services, such as:
- Beneficiary management
- Wallet integration
- Payment processing
- Disaster response modules

### Libraries
Houses reusable code and shared functionalities to avoid duplication and enable consistency across all projects.

### Tools
Includes development, testing, and deployment utilities to streamline engineering workflows and ensure smooth operations.

### Configuration Files
Stores environment settings and deployment configurations to support flexible setups across various use cases and environments.

By adopting this structured yet flexible environment, Rahat supports rapid feature integration, efficient version control, and seamless testing across modules. The platform is designed to adapt to evolving humanitarian needs, regulatory shifts, and emerging technologiesâ€”making it a future-ready solution for impactful, tech-driven aid delivery.
