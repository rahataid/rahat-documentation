Imagine if sending aid to people in need was as easy (and transparent) as sending a text. Thatâ€™s the magic of **Rahat**!

**Rahat** is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that helps humanitarian organizations deliver cash and resources directly to peopleâ€”quickly, securely, and with no middlemen drama.

Whether it's after a disaster, during a crisis, or as a proactive measure (yep, we do early warning systems too!), **Rahat** makes sure help gets where itâ€™s needed, fast.

Weâ€™re talking **smart contracts**, **digital tokens**, and **dashboards** that even non-techies can love. ðŸ’¸âœ¨
