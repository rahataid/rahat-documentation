## üåê Supported Chains and Technologies

Rahat is designed to be a chain-agnostic platform, enabling humanitarian organizations and communities to deploy financial access solutions on the most suitable blockchain infrastructure for their context. Currently, Rahat supports **EVM-compatible blockchains** and **Stellar**, providing flexibility for both programmability and cost-efficiency.

### ‚úÖ Supported Blockchain Networks

* **EVM-Compatible Chains**
  Rahat supports deployment on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, including but not limited to:

  * **Ethereum**
  * **Polygon**
  * **Avalanche**
  * **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**
  * **Local/Test Networks** (e.g., Hardhat, Ganache, Goerli)

  These chains enable smart contract programmability, robust tooling, and wide wallet support, making them suitable for diverse use cases‚Äîfrom local pilots to national-scale implementations.

* **Stellar**
  Known for fast and low-cost transactions, Stellar is ideal for cross-border payments and scalable cash assistance. Rahat uses Stellar‚Äôs core capabilities for asset issuance and transfers and is integrating **Soroban**, Stellar‚Äôs native smart contract platform, for programmable aid workflows.

### üîß Core Technologies and Tools

#### Smart Contracts

* **Solidity** for EVM chains
* **Rust** (via Soroban) for Stellar

Rahat‚Äôs smart contracts manage fund disbursement, token minting, vendor payments, and beneficiary validation.

#### Blockchain Integration

* `ethers.js` and `web3.js` for interacting with EVM chains
* Stellar SDKs and Soroban CLI for Stellar-based operations

#### Backend Stack

* **NestJS** for service-oriented backend architecture
* **Prisma ORM** for database interactions
* **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** for persistence and caching

#### Data Indexing

* **The Graph** protocol is used to index blockchain events for fast, structured access to on-chain data.

#### Identity & Permissions

* Integration of **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** is underway for secure, portable identity.
* **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with project-level granularity ensures operational security.

#### User & Communication Interfaces

* **Twilio** and **Asterisk IVR** for SMS/voice interaction
* **Chatbot and low-tech interfaces** designed for accessibility in low-connectivity areas

#### Wallet & Offramp Support

* Supports **custodial and non-custodial wallets**
* Ongoing integration with offramp services like **Kotani Pay** and **Circle** for cash-out options
