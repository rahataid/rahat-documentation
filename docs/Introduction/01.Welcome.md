# 👋 Welcome to Rahat Docs!

Hey there! Welcome to the Rahat Documentation Hub, your one-stop guide for everything you need to know about Rahat.

Whether you're a developer building on top of Rahat, a team member trying to run a project, or just curious about how things work behind the scenes, you're in the right place.


## 🧭 What’s Inside?

**Developer Docs** – Get into the weeds! Learn how to install, integrate, and build with Rahat.

**User Guides** – Step-by-step tutorials and walkthroughs to help you (or your team) run smooth projects.

**Knowledge Base** – Not sure what "multisig" means or how "offramping" works? We’ve got you covered with clear definitions and context.


## 🗂️ Organized by Project Type

We currently support two major types of humanitarian aid projects on the platform, and our docs reflect that:

### Rahat C2C (Cash-to-Crypto)
This section walks you through how to register beneficiaries, send them digital tokens, allow vendors to redeem those tokens for goods or services, and connect to cash-out services like **Kotani Pay** (a mobile-based offramping service that lets users convert crypto to local currency).

### Rahat AA (Anticipatory Action)
This section covers how to set up early warning systems, automate token disbursements based on forecasts, and use the platform to deliver aid before disasters strike.

Each project has its own set of Developer Docs, User Guides, and Knowledge Base articles, so you can easily find what’s relevant to your project.


## 🚀 Get Started

👉 Setting up your environment or contributing to the platform? Start with the **Developer Docs**.

👉 Implementing or using Rahat in the field? Head over to the **User Guides**.

👉 Still exploring or just curious? The **Knowledge Base** is a great place to dig into the concepts.

Dive in, explore, break things (locally), and build better aid systems with us. We're excited to have you here. Let’s work together to build tech that creates meaningful impact. 🌍✨

**Happy building,**  
— *The Rahat Team* 💚
