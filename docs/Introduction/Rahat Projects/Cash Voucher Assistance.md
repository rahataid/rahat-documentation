## Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)

Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) provides financial support to individuals and families affected by humanitarian crises or participating in development programs. Unlike traditional in-kind aid which involves distributing goods such as food, clothing, or shelter materialsâ€”CVA empowers beneficiaries by giving them the **freedom to choose** what they need most. This approach enhances **dignity, autonomy, and efficiency**, ensuring that support is more tailored to individual needs.

The **Rahat CVA** solution leverages blockchain technology to facilitate **transparent, secure, and traceable** cash and in-kind aid distribution. It is designed to streamline the aid process for humanitarian organizations while making the experience more accessible and inclusive for beneficiaries.
