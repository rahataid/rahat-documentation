# Reporting Issues on the Rahat Platform

Rahat is an open-source platform, and we encourage contributors to help us improve it by reporting issues, whether they are bugs or enhancement suggestions. A well-documented issue helps our team and the community resolve problems efficiently.

## 📌 What Types of Issues Can You Report?

- **Bug Reports**: Unexpected behavior, crashes, or broken features  
- **Enhancements**: Suggestions to improve existing features  
- **New Feature Requests**: Ideas that could enhance Rahat’s functionality  

## 🛠️ How to Report an Issue?

### 1. Check for Existing Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please review the existing issues in the respective repository to ensure it hasn’t already been reported or is currently being addressed.

### 2. Create a New Issue on GitHub

If your issue has not been reported yet:

- Click on the **“New Issue”** button located at the top right corner (green button)

Each issue should include:

- Clear and detailed descriptions with all necessary information
