# Rahat C2C Project

The Rahat C2C Project is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate Crypto-to-Crypto Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA), focusing on secure and transparent aid distribution. Developed by Rumsan, it leverages a monorepo architecture to streamline crypto transactions for humanitarian and financial inclusion purposes. Below is a detailed understanding of the project based on its technology stack and functionality, as well as insights from available sources:

## Key Capabilities

- **Deposit Token**: Users can deposit crypto assets via a QR code-generated link, enabling seamless interaction with the platform  
- **Multi-Sig Disbursement**: Disbursements require multiple approvals through a Safe wallet integration, ensuring security and accountability  
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Whitelisting controls who can perform disbursement transactions, adding a layer of access control  
- **Execution Details**: Tracks the executor and timestamp of transactions for transparency  
- **Disbursement Flow**: Funds are directed back to a Safe wallet via a multi-sig process, ensuring secure fund management  
 and secure crypto aid distribution in vulnerable communities.
