# Introduction

## Rahat Crypto CVA

**Rahat Crypto CVA** is one of the projects under the **Rahat platform** that leverages blockchain technology to deliver crypto-based **Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)** in humanitarian settings. Designed to serve underbanked and vulnerable populations—especially during disasters—Rahat enables secure, transparent, and direct disbursement of aid using stablecoins like **USDC**.

As more humanitarian organizations embrace crypto donations, Rahat bridges the gap between **donors and beneficiaries** by streamlining both **first-mile and last-mile aid distribution**. 

The platform supports both **documented and undocumented individuals**—such as refugees—by enabling **community-based verification and onboarding**, even without formal IDs or bank accounts.
