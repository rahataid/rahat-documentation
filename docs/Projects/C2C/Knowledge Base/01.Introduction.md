# Introduction

Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) is a way of helping people during emergencies by giving them money or vouchers instead of goods like food or blankets. This lets people buy what they really need, when they need it, from local shops. It’s faster, more flexible, and often more respectful because it gives people more control over their lives. For example, someone might use the money to buy medicine, pay rent, or get school supplies for their children.

## Cryptocurrency and CVA

Cryptocurrencies are providing new, innovative ways to deliver cash assistance, especially in places where traditional banking systems are slow, costly, or inaccessible. By using digital tokens on decentralized networks, humanitarian organizations can reach people faster, with more control and transparency.

### What Is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that works over the internet without needing a bank or middleman. Instead of being printed like paper money, it’s created and tracked using **blockchain technology**—a secure and transparent digital ledger that records all transactions.

Popular cryptocurrencies include **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**, but in humanitarian settings, stablecoins like **USDC** or **USDT** are preferred. These are tied to real-world currencies (like the US Dollar), so their value stays stable, making them better suited for aid delivery.

### The Role of Blockchain

Blockchain is the system where cryptocurrency transactions are stored (like a database). A transaction simply means sending or receiving digital money—like when aid is sent to a beneficiary’s wallet. Blockchain works like a public ledger that everyone can see but no one can change. This makes each payment secure, easy to track, and trustworthy, helping ensure that aid goes to the right people and nothing gets lost or misused.

## Benefits of Using Cryptocurrency

- **Speed:** Funds can be sent in minutes across borders without delays from banks or intermediaries.  
- **Transparency:** Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain and can be tracked, helping ensure accountability from donor to recipient.  
- **Security:** Cryptographic technology secures transactions, making them difficult to hack or alter.  
- **Global Accessibility and Payout:** With just internet access, anyone can receive, hold, and use crypto across borders—no bank account required.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Volatility:** Some cryptocurrencies can change value quickly. That’s why stablecoins—crypto tokens tied to real-world currencies—are used in CVA.
- **Legal and Regulatory Constraints:** Some countries restrict the use of crypto or lack clear regulations. It’s important to follow local laws.
- **Accessibility and Digital Literacy:** Not everyone is familiar with digital wallets. Education and easy-to-use tools are essential to ensure beneficiaries can use crypto safely.

## [Digital CVA - Knowledge Base](https://docs-dev.rahat.io/docs/next/Projects/C2C/Knowledge%20Base/Introduction)

Digital Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) offers financial help to individuals and families during crises or development programs. Unlike traditional aid that provides physical goods, CVA gives people the freedom to choose and buy what they need most, whether it's food, shelter, or services.

**Crypto helps send aid faster, cheaper, and more securely—especially in crisis zones or places with weak banking systems.** It allows direct transfers to beneficiaries, reducing delays and middlemen. Stablecoins offer price stability, and all transactions are transparent and traceable on the blockchain. This builds trust, ensures accountability, and makes it easier to reach people in hard-to-access areas.
