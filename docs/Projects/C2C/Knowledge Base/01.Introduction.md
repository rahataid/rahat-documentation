## Introduction

**Digital Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)** offers financial help to individuals and families during crises or development programs. Unlike traditional aid that provides physical goods, CVA gives people the freedom to choose and buy what they need most, whether it's food, shelter, or services.

**Cryptocurrency** helps send aid faster, cheaper, and more securely—especially in crisis zones or places with weak banking systems. It allows direct transfers to beneficiaries, reducing delays and middlemen. **Stablecoins** offer price stability, and all transactions are transparent and traceable on the blockchain. This builds trust, ensures accountability, and makes it easier to reach people in hard-to-access areas.

**Rahat crypto transfer** is a digital platform that helps deliver aid quickly and securely using cryptocurrency. It allows humanitarian organizations to manage aid projects, register recipients, and send funds directly to people’s digital wallets. The system includes features like:

- QR code vouchers  
- Communication tools to send voice and text messages  
- A vendor app for easy fund withdrawal using SMS  
- Fund transfer tracking through banks  
- Real-time reporting for transparency  

Overall, **crypto makes the aid process faster, safer, and more transparent**.
