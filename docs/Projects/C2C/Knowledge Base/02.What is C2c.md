## Rahat Crypto CVA

Rahat Crypto CVA is one of the project under the Rahat platform that leverages blockchain technology to deliver crypto-based Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) in humanitarian settings. Designed to serve underbanked and vulnerable populations—especially during disasters—Rahat enables secure, transparent, and direct disbursement of aid using stablecoins like USDC.

As more humanitarian organizations embrace crypto donations, Rahat bridges the gap between donors and beneficiaries by streamlining both first-mile and last-mile aid distribution. The platform supports both documented and undocumented individuals—such as refugees—by enabling community-based verification and onboarding, even without formal IDs or bank accounts.
