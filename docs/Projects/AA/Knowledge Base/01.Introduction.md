# Introduction

## Anticipatory Action (AA) and Rahat

**Anticipatory Action (AA)** is a forward-looking humanitarian approach that delivers aid **before a disaster strikes**, using forecast data to reduce human suffering and economic loss. Acting in anticipation holds immense potential to **save lives** and **minimize losses**.

However, in most cases, the available lead time before the hazard strikes is **too short** to complete all necessary actions.

**Rahat** addresses this challenge by leveraging **blockchain-based smart contracts**, combined with **configurable multi-signature mechanisms**, to automate critical anticipatory actions as soon as the activation phase is triggered.

These include:

- Sending text and voice-based early warning communications to beneficiaries and stakeholders
- Disbursing digital tokens to pre-registered beneficiaries

This ensures that aid and information are distributed **timely**, **securely**, and **transparently** as soon as predefined triggers are met.

By automating these time-sensitive processes, Rahat significantly improves the **efficiency** and **speed** of early action—particularly in disseminating lifesaving alerts and distributing aid.

Given that anticipatory action is still an **emerging approach** in disaster risk reduction, the potential of technology—especially **blockchain**—to expedite and scale early actions remains largely untapped.

**Rahat** aims to bridge this gap by offering a **digital solution tailored to the unique time-critical needs** of anticipatory humanitarian response.
