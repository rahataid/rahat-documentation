# Introduction

**Anticipatory Action (AA)** is a forward-looking humanitarian approach that delivers aid *before* a disaster strikes, using forecast data to reduce human suffering and economic loss. Acting in anticipation holds immense potential to save lives and minimize losses. However, in many cases, the available lead time before a hazard strikes is too short to complete all necessary actions.

**Rahat** addresses this challenge by leveraging **blockchain-based smart contracts** and configurable **multi-signature mechanisms** to automate critical anticipatory actions as soon as the activation phase is triggered. These include:

- Sending text and voice-based early warning communications to beneficiaries and stakeholders  
- Disbursing digital tokens to pre-registered beneficiaries  

This ensures that aid and information are distributed **timely**, **securely**, and **transparently** as soon as predefined triggers are met. By automating these time-sensitive processes, Rahat significantly improves the **efficiency** and **speed** of early actionâ€”particularly in disseminating lifesaving alerts and distributing aid.

Anticipatory action is still an emerging approach in disaster risk reduction. The potential of technology, especially **blockchain**, to expedite and scale early actions remains largely untapped. **Rahat** aims to bridge this gap by offering a **digital solution tailored to the unique time-critical needs** of anticipatory humanitarian response.
