# Rahat Project C2C - Technical Introduction

## Overview

The Rahat Project C2C (Crypto-2-Crypto) is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient token disbursement for humanitarian aid and development projects. The system leverages smart contracts, multi-signature wallets, and decentralized infrastructure to ensure trustless and auditable financial transactions.

## Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using Nx, containing multiple applications and libraries:

- **Backend API** (`apps/c2c/`) - NestJS-based REST API
- **Smart Contracts** (`apps/contracts/`) - Solidity smart contracts for blockchain operations
- **Subgraph** (`apps/graph/`) - The Graph protocol for blockchain data indexing
- **React Query Library** (`libs/react-query/`) - Frontend data fetching and state management
- **Extensions Library** (`libs/extensions/`) - Shared DTOs and utilities
- **Contract Library** (`libs/contract/`) - Smart contract abstractions

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Queue System**: Bull with Redis
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

#### Blockchain
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.20
- **Framework**: Hardhat with Ignition deployment
- **Networks**: Base Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai, Arbitrum Sepolia
- **Multi-sig**: Safe Protocol integration
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20

#### Frontend & Data
- **GraphQL**: The Graph protocol for blockchain data
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Web3 Integration**: Wagmi, Viem, Ethers.js
- **React Query**: TanStack Query for data fetching

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

#### C2CProject Contract
The main contract managing project operations:

```solidity
contract C2CProject is AbstractProject, IC2CProject {
    // Token management
    function withdrawToken(address _tokenAddress, address _withdrawAddress)
    function disburseProjectToken(address _tokenAddress, address _beneficiary, uint256 _amount)
    function disburseOwnedToken(address _tokenAddress, address _beneficiary, uint256 _amount)
    
    // Beneficiary management
    function addBeneficiary(address _beneficiary)
    function removeBeneficiary(address _beneficiary)
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Token disbursement with balance validation
- Beneficiary whitelisting and management
- Multi-signature approval workflows
- Event emission for transparency

#### RahatToken Contract
ERC-20 token implementation for the platform's native currency.

### 2. Backend API Modules

#### Beneficiary Management
- Enrollment and verification of beneficiaries
- Wallet address management
- Referral system for beneficiary onboarding
- Group-based organization

#### Campaign Management
- Campaign creation and configuration
- Message distribution via multiple transport channels
- Beneficiary group targeting

#### Disbursement System
- Multi-signature disbursement workflows
- Token allocation and transfer
- Approval tracking and audit trails
- Integration with Safe Protocol

#### Communication Module
- Multi-channel communication (SMS, Email, Push)
- Template-based messaging
- Delivery status tracking

### 3. Database Schema

#### Core Entities
- **Beneficiaries**: Users receiving aid with wallet addresses
- **Campaigns**: Aid distribution campaigns with targeting
- **Disbursements**: Token transfer records with approval status
- **Settings**: System configuration and parameters
- **Stats**: Analytics and reporting data

#### Key Relationships
- Beneficiaries can participate in multiple campaigns
- Disbursements are linked to specific beneficiaries and campaigns
- Multi-signature approvals track the approval workflow

### 4. Subgraph (Blockchain Data Indexing)

The Graph protocol indexes blockchain events for efficient querying:

- **Token Transfers**: All ERC-20 token movements
- **Beneficiary Events**: Addition/removal of beneficiaries
- **Approval Events**: Multi-signature approval tracking
- **Project Events**: Token budget changes and allocations

## Use Cases

### 1. Humanitarian Aid Distribution

**Scenario**: International NGO distributing cash assistance to disaster-affected communities

**Workflow**:
1. **Project Setup**: Deploy C2CProject contract with multi-signature configuration
2. **Beneficiary Enrollment**: Register affected individuals with their wallet addresses
3. **Campaign Creation**: Create aid distribution campaign with targeting criteria
4. **Token Funding**: Transfer tokens to project contract via multi-signature
5. **Disbursement**: Execute token transfers to beneficiary wallets
6. **Verification**: Track all transactions on blockchain for transparency

**Benefits**:
- Transparent fund flow tracking
- Reduced corruption through blockchain immutability
- Real-time disbursement status
- Automated compliance reporting

### 2. Development Project Funding

**Scenario**: Government agency managing development project grants

**Workflow**:
1. **Grant Allocation**: Set up project with approved budget
2. **Beneficiary Selection**: Enroll qualified recipients
3. **Milestone-based Disbursement**: Release funds based on project milestones
4. **Multi-party Approval**: Require multiple signatures for large disbursements
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for compliance

### 3. Microfinance and Small Grants

**Scenario**: Microfinance institution providing small loans and grants

**Workflow**:
1. **Application Processing**: Enroll loan/grant applicants
2. **Credit Scoring**: Integrate with external verification systems
3. **Disbursement**: Transfer tokens to approved recipients
4. **Repayment Tracking**: Monitor loan repayments
5. **Reporting**: Generate compliance and impact reports

### 4. Emergency Response

**Scenario**: Rapid response to humanitarian crises

**Workflow**:
1. **Rapid Deployment**: Quick project setup with pre-approved templates
2. **Mobile Onboarding**: QR code-based beneficiary registration
3. **Immediate Disbursement**: Fast token transfers to affected individuals
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live tracking of aid distribution
5. **Impact Assessment**: Data collection for response evaluation

## Technical Features

### 1. Multi-Signature Security
