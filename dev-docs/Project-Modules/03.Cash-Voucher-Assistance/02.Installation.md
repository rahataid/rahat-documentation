This guide provides comprehensive setup instructions for the Rahat Project Payroll (CVA - Cash Voucher Assistance) system. This is a blockchain-based CVA system built with NestJS, Hardhat, and The Graph that enables secure, transparent, and efficient CVA management with blockchain integration.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Rahat Voucher Assistance system, you need to have the rahat-platform running. Please refer to the [Rahat Platform Setup Guide](../Getting-Started/02.Setting-up-Local-Environment.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the core Rahat platform.

**Note:** This project depends on the rahat-platform being operational. Ensure the platform is running before proceeding with the voucher assistance setup.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rahat-project-rp
```

### 2. Bootstrap the Project

The bootstrap command will set up the entire project environment:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
```

This command performs the following operations:
- Installs all dependencies across the monorepo
- Sets up environment variables
- Generates Prisma client
- Runs database migrations
- Seeds initial data
- Sets up The Graph subgraph

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
pnpm start
```

This starts the NestJS API server in development mode.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo built with Nx containing multiple applications:

### Apps

- **`apps/rp`** - Main NestJS API server
- **`apps/contracts`** - Smart contracts (Hardhat)
- **`apps/graph`** - The Graph subgraph for blockchain indexing
- **`apps/rp-e2e`** - End-to-end tests

### Libraries

- **`libs/extensions`** - Shared utilities and extensions

## Architecture Overview

### Backend API (`apps/rp`)

The main NestJS application provides REST APIs for:

- **Beneficiary Management** - Add, update, and manage beneficiaries
- **Vendor Management** - Handle vendor operations and redemptions
- **Disbursement Plans** - Create and manage payment plans
- **Blockchain Integration** - Process blockchain transactions
- **Communication** - Handle notifications and messaging

### Smart Contracts (`apps/contracts`)

Solidity contracts deployed on blockchain networks:

- **RahatToken** - ERC20 token for disbursements
- **RahatPayrollProject** - Main CVA project contract
- **RahatClaim** - Claim processing contract
- **RahatTreasury** - Treasury management
- **RahatAccessManager** - Access control
- **Vendor** - Vendor management
- **Redemptions** - Redemption processing

### The Graph Subgraph (`apps/graph`)

Indexes blockchain events and provides GraphQL API for:

- Token transfers and approvals
- CVA project events
- Claim processing
- Beneficiary management
- Vendor operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://rahat:rahat@localhost:5432/rahat-rp"

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

# Blockchain
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
RPC_URL=your_rpc_url

# The Graph
GRAPH_NODE_URL=http://localhost:8020
IPFS_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

### Database Setup

The project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The bootstrap script will:

1. Create the database
2. Run migrations
3. Seed initial data
4. Set up The Graph subgraph

## Available Scripts

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm start

# Build the application
pnpm build:rp

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Reset database and reseed
pnpm reset
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Run migrations
pnpm migrate:dev

# Reset database
pnpm migrate:reset

# Open Prisma Studio
pnpm prisma:studio

# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma:generate
```

### Smart Contracts

```bash
# Compile contracts
pnpm contracts:compile

# Run contract tests
pnpm contracts:test

# Generate coverage report
pnpm contracts:coverage

# Deploy contracts
pnpm contracts:ignite:rahatToken
```

### The Graph

```bash
# Generate GraphQL types
pnpm graph:codegen

# Build subgraph
pnpm graph:build

# Deploy to hosted service
pnpm graph:deploy

# Local development
pnpm graph:deploy-local
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run e2e tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run contract tests
pnpm contracts:test
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Prisma Studio

```bash
pnpm prisma:studio
```

Access the database GUI at http://localhost:5555

### The Graph Playground

```bash
pnpm graph:deploy-local
```

Access the GraphQL playground at the URL provided in the output

## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build:all
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.rp -t rahat-project-payroll .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Check DATABASE_URL in .env file
   - Verify database exists and is accessible

2. **Contract Compilation Errors**
   - Check Node.js version (requires v18+)
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Hardhat configuration

3. **The Graph Issues**
   - Ensure Docker is running
   - Check if ports 8000, 8001, 8002, 8003, 8004, 8005, 8020, 5001 are available
   - Verify subgraph configuration

### Reset Everything

If you encounter issues, you can reset the entire setup:

```bash
# Reset database and reseed
pnpm reset

# Clean and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm bootstrap
```

## Next Steps

After successful setup:

1. **Explore the API** - Use the provided API documentation to understand available endpoints
2. **Deploy Contracts** - Deploy smart contracts to your target blockchain network
3. **Configure The Graph** - Set up indexing for your deployed contracts
4. **Run Tests** - Ensure all components are working correctly
5. **Start Development** - Begin building your CVA application
