:::tip What you'll learn
This section explains the core architecture of Rahat system, breaking down its main components and how they work together.
:::

The Rahat system is structured around two core concepts: the **Rahat Platform** and **Rahat Projects**. The platform acts as the foundation, while projects are modular applications that inherit its capabilities and can be extended based on specific use cases.

## 🏗️ 1. Rahat Platform

<details>
<summary>What is Rahat Platform?</summary>

The **Rahat Platform** is the foundational layer that powers the entire Rahat ecosystem. It provides shared infrastructure, services, and tools required to build, run, and manage aid and financial inclusion projects on the blockchain.

</details>

### Core Components

Key responsibilities of the platform include:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

📱 **Identity and Wallet Management**
> Automatic provisioning of blockchain wallets linked to decentralized identities (DIDs) for beneficiaries, agents, and other users.

🔐 **Authorization and Role-Based Access Control**
> Multi-level access and permission system managing both platform-level and project-level access.

⛓️ **Blockchain Gateway**
> Meta-transaction support, contract interaction, and transaction relaying on behalf of users.

💬 **Communication Layer**
> Unified messaging interface (SMS, IVR, Voice) to reach users regardless of device or internet access.

📊 **Admin Interface & Monitoring Tools**
> Central dashboard to oversee project operations, user management, token flows, and audit logs.

🗄️ **Data Indexing and Caching**
> Off-chain data caching and query layer using tools like The Graph to efficiently access blockchain state.

:::info Platform Features
The platform is **generic and reusable**, designed to serve multiple projects simultaneously, providing:
- ✅ Consistency
- 🛡️ Security
- 📈 Scalability

## 🚀 2. Rahat Projects

**Rahat Projects** are standalone, use-case-specific applications that plug into the Rahat Platform. Each project defines its own business logic, configuration, and lifecycle while leveraging the services provided by the platform.

### 🔧 Characteristics of Rahat Projects:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Independent Workflows | Each project manages its own flow—for example, registration, verification, disbursement, redemption |
| Customizable Logic | Projects can define rules, conditions, triggers, and user interactions based on the aid model |
| Reusable Components | Projects inherit wallet, messaging, auth, and other services from the platform |
| Extensible | Developers can clone or fork existing projects, build new ones using the SDK |

### 📦 Examples of Rahat Projects:

<details>
