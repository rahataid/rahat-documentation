# Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for developing with the Rahat platform:

## Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)

Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) is a humanitarian assistance approach that provides individuals with cash or vouchers for goods and services, rather than direct in-kind assistance. In Rahat:

- **Digital Tokens**: Represent either cash value or vouchers for specific goods/services
- **Distribution Mechanisms**: Include mobile money transfers, blockchain-based tokens, or SMS-based vouchers
- **Redemption Process**: Beneficiaries can redeem tokens at registered local vendors

## Projects

Projects are distinct aid initiatives with specific:

- **Timeline**: Start and end dates for the assistance program
- **Geographic Scope**: Targeted regions, communities, or populations
- **Distribution Strategy**: Token types, distribution mechanisms, and redemption rules
- **Funding Source**: Organizations or donors providing financial support
- **Team Structure**: Admins, field agents, and coordinators with different permission levels

## Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries are individuals or households receiving assistance:

- **Identification**: Unique identifiers (often using phone numbers or biometric data)
- **Registration**: Process of adding beneficiaries to the system with verification
- **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Identity verification procedures that vary by project
- **Distribution Targeting**: Selection criteria for different types of assistance
- **Communication Channels**: SMS, phone calls, or in-person interactions

## Tokens

Tokens are the digital representation of aid value:

- **Token Types**:
  - **Fungible**: Represent generic value (like cash)
  - **Non-Fungible**: Represent specific goods or services
  
- **Token Operations**:
  - **Minting**: Creation of new tokens for distribution
  - **Distribution**: Assigning tokens to beneficiaries
  - **Redemption**: Exchange of tokens for goods/services at vendors
  - **Burning**: Removal of tokens after redemption

- **Smart Contracts**: Control the rules for token creation, distribution, and redemption

## Vendors

Vendors are local businesses that accept tokens from beneficiaries:

- **Onboarding**: Process of registering and verifying local businesses
- **Point-of-Service**: Applications/systems vendors use to accept tokens
- **Settlement**: Process of converting redeemed tokens to fiat currency
- **Reporting**: Tracking transactions and inventory for accountability

## Agency

Agencies are humanitarian organizations that:

- **Deploy Projects**: Set up and manage aid distribution programs
- **Manage Funds**: Allocate resources for token distribution
- **Monitor Progress**: Track distribution and redemption activities
- **Generate Reports**: Create accountability and impact reports

Understanding these concepts and their implementation in Rahat is crucial for effective development and extension of the platform.
