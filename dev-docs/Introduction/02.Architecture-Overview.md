# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

:::tip What is Rahat Platform?
The **Rahat Platform** is a modular and extensible foundation for building humanitarian aid and financial inclusion projects using blockchain. It provides a common infrastructure layer that handles identity, authorization, wallet provisioning, transaction coordination, and communications—allowing individual projects to focus solely on their domain-specific logic.
:::

## 🔄 Platform + Projects Model

At a high level, the architecture follows a **platform + projects** model:

🏢 **Rahat Platform**
- Provides core services and interfaces that power the ecosystem
- Manages fundamental infrastructure components
- Ensures security and reliability

🔌 **Projects**
- Act like independent **microservices**
- Built on top of the platform
- Each represents a specific use case (e.g., cash assistance, anticipatory action, voucher distribution)

## 🤝 Platform and Project Relationship

Rahat is designed to support multiple types of projects running concurrently within the same environment. These projects share common infrastructure but can have different flows, rules, and modules.

## 🎯 Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **🧩 Modularity** | Projects are plug-and-play; reuse or extend platform services |
| **🎨 Customizability** | Build and deploy your own project types using Rahat SDK and APIs |
| **📈 Scalability** | Onboard new projects without modifying the core platform |
| **🔄 Separation of Concerns** | Core platform manages infrastructure; projects manage business logic |
