**Event Indexing** - The process of tracking and storing blockchain events for efficient querying. Rahat uses The Graph protocol to index events like token transfers, beneficiary registrations, and claim processing.

## F

**Fungible Token** - A type of token where each unit is identical and interchangeable, like cash. Rahat uses fungible tokens to represent generic value for aid distribution.

## G

**Gas Fees** - Small costs paid to the blockchain network for processing cryptocurrency transactions. These fees vary by network and transaction complexity.

**GraphQL** - A query language and runtime for APIs that provides a complete description of the data available. Rahat uses GraphQL through The Graph protocol for efficient blockchain data querying.

**Group** - A collection of beneficiaries organized by geographic, social, economic, or other criteria for targeted aid distribution.

## H

**Hardhat** - A development environment for Ethereum that helps developers compile, deploy, test, and debug smart contracts. Rahat uses Hardhat for smart contract development and testing.

## I

**Identity Verification** - The process of confirming a beneficiary's identity, often through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures that vary by project requirements.

## J

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** - A secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. Rahat uses JWT for authentication and authorization across its services.

## K

**KYC (Know Your Customer)** - Identity verification procedures used to verify the identity of beneficiaries and prevent fraud. KYC requirements vary by project and regulatory context.

**Key Concepts** - Fundamental ideas and principles that are essential for understanding and working with the Rahat platform, including CVA, blockchain technology, and beneficiary management.

## L

**Local Vendor** - A registered business or service provider that accepts Rahat tokens from beneficiaries in exchange for goods or services. Vendors are onboarded through a verification process.

## M

**MetaMask** - A popular self-managed crypto wallet used in browsers or mobile apps to interact with blockchain applications.

**Microservice** - An architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Rahat uses a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.

**Minting** - The process of creating new tokens for distribution. In Rahat, tokens are minted by the treasury and allocated to beneficiaries.

**Multi-signature (Multisig) Wallet** - A wallet that requires multiple people or entities to approve a transaction, used for security in managing donor funds and critical operations.

## N

**NestJS** - A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications. Rahat's backend services are built using NestJS.

**Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** - A type of token that represents specific goods or services rather than generic value. Each NFT is unique and not interchangeable.

## O

**Offramping** - The process of converting cryptocurrency into local money or mobile money. Rahat provides offramping services to help beneficiaries access local currency.

**OTP (One-Time Password)** - A temporary password used for secure verification, particularly in claim processing and beneficiary authentication.

## P

**Point-of-Service** - Applications or systems that vendors use to accept tokens from beneficiaries and process redemptions.

**Private Key** - A secret cryptographic key used to sign transactions and prove ownership of blockchain assets. Private keys must be kept secure and confidential.

**Project** - A specific aid distribution program with defined timeline, geographic scope, distribution strategy, funding source, and team structure.
