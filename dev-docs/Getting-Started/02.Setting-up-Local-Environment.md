# 🛠️ Setting up Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for Rahat. The setup consists of two main parts:

1. 🏗️ Setting up the core Rahat platform (rahat-platform and rahat-ui)
2. 🎯 Setting up a specific project implementation (CVA by default)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the [Requirements](./Prerequisites) page.

---

## 🏗️ Part 1: Setting up Core Rahat Platform

### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Core Repositories

```bash
# Clone the platform repository
git clone https://github.com/rahataid/rahat-platform.git
cd rahat-platform

# Install dependencies using PNPM
pnpm install

# Clone the UI repository in a separate directory
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/rahataid/rahat-ui.git
cd rahat-ui

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### ⚙️ Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create environment files for both repositories:

```bash
# For rahat-platform
cd ../rahat-platform
cp .env.example .env

# For rahat-ui
cd ../rahat-ui
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Important**: Configure your environment variables according to your local setup.

Key variables include:
* 🗄️ Database connection details
* ⛓️ Blockchain network endpoints
* 🔑 API keys for external services
* 🌐 Local ports and host settings

### 🗄️ Step 3: Database Setup

Start the PostgreSQL and Redis services using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
cd packages/api
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run db:seed # Optional: Add sample data
```

### 🚀 Step 4: Start Core Services

#### Start the API Service:
```bash
cd packages/api
pnpm run start:dev
```
> The API service will be available at `http://localhost:3001` by default.

#### Start the Web Application:
```bash
cd packages/app
pnpm run dev
```
> The web application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## 🎯 Part 2: Setting up Project Implementation

### CVA Project Setup (Recommended for New Users)

The CVA (Cash and Voucher Assistance) project demonstrates the basic implementation of Rahat.

```bash
# Clone the CVA project repository
git clone https://github.com/rahataid/rahat-cva.git
cd rahat-cva

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment files
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Note**: Configure the CVA project's environment variables to connect with your core platform setup.

## 🚀 Running the Complete Stack

1. Start the platform services:
```bash
# In rahat-platform directory
pnpm run start:dev

# In rahat-ui directory (new terminal)
pnpm run dev
```

2. Start your project services:
```bash
# In rahat-cva directory (new terminal)
pnpm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Verify Your Setup

1. Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Sign in with the default administrator credentials:
   * 👤 Email: `admin@example.com`
   * 🔑 Password: `rahat123`
3. Check the API health at `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

## 🛠️ Development Scripts

The repository includes several helpful development scripts:

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Start all services in development mode |
| `pnpm run build` | Build all packages |
| `pnpm run test` | Run tests across all packages |
| `pnpm run lint` | Run linting across all packages |
