# Setting up Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for Rahat:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the [Requirements](./01.Requirements.md) page.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/rahataid/rahat.git
cd rahat

# Install dependencies using PNPM
pnpm install
```

## Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create environment files for each package:

```bash
# Copy example environment files
cp packages/api/.env.example packages/api/.env
cp packages/app/.env.example packages/app/.env
cp packages/contracts/.env.example packages/contracts/.env
```

Configure your environment variables according to your local setup. Key variables include:

- Database connection details
- Blockchain network endpoints
- API keys for external services
- Local ports and host settings

## Step 3: Database Setup

Start the PostgreSQL and Redis services using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
cd packages/api
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run db:seed # Optional: Add sample data
```

## Step 4: Start the Blockchain Network

For local development, start a local Ethereum node:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm run node
```

In another terminal, deploy the contracts:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm run deploy:local
```

Take note of the deployed contract addresses, as you'll need them for your environment configuration.

## Step 5: Start the API Service

```bash
cd packages/api
pnpm run start:dev
```

The API service will be available at http://localhost:3001 by default.

## Step 6: Start the Web Application

```bash
cd packages/app
pnpm run dev
```

The web application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Step 7: Setting Up TheGraph Indexing (Optional)

If you want to work with TheGraph for data indexing:

```bash
cd packages/subgraph
pnpm run create-local
pnpm run deploy-local
```

## Step 8: Setting Up SMS/IVR Service (Optional)

If you're working on the SMS or IVR integration:

```bash
cd packages/sms-service
pnpm run start:dev
```

## Verify Your Setup

1. Open the web application at http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with the default administrator credentials:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: rahat123

3. Check the API connection at http://localhost:3001/api/health

## Development Scripts

The repository includes several helpful development scripts:

- `pnpm run dev`: Start all services in development mode
- `pnpm run build`: Build all packages
- `pnpm run test`: Run tests across all packages
- `pnpm run lint`: Run linting across all packages
