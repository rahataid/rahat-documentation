# 🛠️ Setting up Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for Rahat. The setup consists of two main parts:

1. 🏗️ Setting up the core Rahat platform (rahat-platform and rahat-ui)
2. 🎯 Setting up a specific project implementation (CVA by default)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the [Requirements](./Prerequisites) page.
