# v3.1.0 

We are excited to announce several significant updates to the Rahat platform, aimed at enhancing performance, scalability, and usability. This release introduces a range of enhancements across both the backend and frontend, alongside new tools and features designed to streamline operations and provide a more robust experience for users.

### Key Updates

- **Upgraded Backend to Monorepo Using Nx:**  
  The Rahat backend has been restructured into a monorepo using [Nx](https://nx.dev/), a powerful build system with first-class support for many frontend and backend technologies. This reorganization simplifies dependency management, improves code sharing, and enhances the overall development workflow, making it easier to maintain and scale the codebase.

- **Implemented Microservice Architecture in Rahat Platform:**  
  To better manage and modularize the backend services, we have adopted a microservice architecture. This approach breaks down the Rahat platform into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately, ensuring better fault isolation, easier maintenance, and greater flexibility in responding to evolving user needs.

- **Introduced Subgraph to Query Blockchain Data:**  
  We have introduced a new subgraph to enable efficient querying of blockchain data. This tool allows developers and users to access blockchain data more effectively, providing faster and more reliable data retrieval. The subgraph significantly enhances the platform's capability to interact with blockchain networks, supporting more complex queries and analytics.

- **Introduced `rahat-project-c2c` Microservice for Crypto-to-Crypto Transfers:**  
  A new microservice, [`rahat-project-c2c`](https://github.com/rahataid/rahat-project-c2c/releases/tag/v1.0.0), has been developed to handle crypto-to-crypto transfers seamlessly. This service enables efficient, secure, and transparent transactions across different cryptocurrency assets, expanding the platform's capabilities in managing blockchain-based financial operations.

- **Created SDK Packages to Communicate with Rahat Backend:**  
  To simplify integration with the Rahat backend, we have released several SDK packages that provide standardized methods for interacting with our platform's APIs. These SDKs are designed to facilitate rapid development and ensure consistency across different applications:
  - **SDK:** A core library that offers a comprehensive set of interfaces for interacting with Rahat APIs. [Available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rahataid/sdk).
  - **Contracts:** A library for the base smart contracts used by rahat. [Available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rahataid/contracts).

- **Upgraded Frontend to Monorepo:**  
  The frontend of the Rahat platform has also been upgraded to a monorepo structure, allowing for more efficient code management and sharing across different projects. This update enhances the development workflow by providing a unified codebase that is easier to navigate and maintain.

- **Introduced Beneficiary Management Tool:**  
  A new Beneficiary Management Tool has been integrated into the platform to streamline the management of beneficiaries. This tool offers a range of features to enhance beneficiary operations, including:
  - **Importing Beneficiaries Using Excel or Kobo:** Easily import beneficiary data from Excel sheets or Kobo forms, reducing manual entry and ensuring accuracy.
  - **Dynamic Beneficiary Fields:** Customize fields based on specific project needs, providing flexibility in managing diverse data.
  - **Grouping Beneficiaries:** Organize beneficiaries into groups for targeted interventions and efficient management.
  - **Targeting Based on Dynamic Fields:** Use dynamic fields to filter and target specific beneficiaries for various projects or aid distributions.
  - **Exporting Beneficiaries to Rahat Platform:** Export beneficiary data to the Rahat platform, ensuring seamless integration and data consistency.

- **Introduced Vendor App in Ionic Version:**  
  The vendor app has been updated and re-released using the [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/), which allows for a more responsive and cross-platform compatible mobile experience. The revamped app features an enhanced user interface, providing vendors with a more intuitive and efficient way to manage transactions and interact with the Rahat platform.
