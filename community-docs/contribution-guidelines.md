# Contribution Guidelines

We would love to have your help. Before you start working, however, please read and follow this short guide.

## Getting Started

Namaste, Rahat development team would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute! We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Getting involved with Rahat community

We have created guidelines for contributing to Rahat project and packages. These are guidelines, not rules. We encourage you to use your best judgment and feel free to recommend changes to this document in a pull request. We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## How to contribute to the Rahat Project?

If you want to contribute, this section guides you through submitting a bug report for Rahat. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Creating Pull Request

The best way to contribute to this project is by making a pull request in the following ways:

- Fork the Rahat project and work on your fork
- Create a new branch on which you want to make changes - "git checkout -b 'my-contribution' " or push your changes on develop branch
- Please make one pull request per issue to avoid large merges.
- Commit your change with a commit message describing the correction.
- Submit a pull request against the Rahat repository. 

In general, all pull requests must:
- Have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of the project
- Have unit tests, functional tests, and fuzz tests, where appropriate
- Follow code style guidelines
- Not break the existing test suite
- Where bugs are fixed, where possible, there should be unit tests demonstrating the bug and also proving the fix. This helps prevent regression.
- Change relevant comments and documentation when the behavior of code changes.
