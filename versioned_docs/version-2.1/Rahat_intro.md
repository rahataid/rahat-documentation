**Rahat**, meaning "relief" in Nepali, is a blockchain-powered platform designed to break down barriers to financial inclusion and build resilience for marginalized communities. Developed by **Rumsan**, Rahat is an open-source project that is transforming the way vulnerable populations access financial services and digital tools.

## Key Features of Rahat:

- **Blockchain-powered Financial Access**: Secure and transparent transactions, enabling financial inclusion for the underserved.
