# Overview

## Purpose and Structure

The **Rahat Platform** serves as a comprehensive financial access platform designed to provide cash voucher assistance (CVA) through blockchain-based tokens, enabling efficient fund distribution in humanitarian contexts. It facilitates seamless communication between humanitarian organizations, beneficiaries, and financial systems, ensuring transparency, traceability, and security for all transactions.

[Rahat Platform](https://github.com/rahataid/rahat-platform) is the central codebase that enables the management, development, and deployment of various projects within a unified ecosystem. It is built to support a modular approach, where independent project and teams can work on isolated components of the platform without interfering with other areas, ensuring a smooth and scalable development process. The modular design also supports flexibility, allowing different components of the platform to be updated or extended without disrupting the entire system.

The repository is structured to ensure scalability and maintainability over time, organizing the codebase into logical directories, such as:

- **Applications**: Where different Rahat-related applications and services are housed, supporting various features like beneficiary management, wallet integration, payment processing, and disaster response projects.
  
- **Libraries**: Reusable pieces of code and shared functionality, making it easy for developers to implement common features across different projects within Rahat without duplication of effort.

- **Tools**: Utility scripts and tools that assist in the development, testing, and deployment processes, making operations more efficient and ensuring consistent project management.

- **Configuration Files**: Key configuration files and environment settings, helping to standardize deployment processes and keep the system easily configurable for different use cases and environments.

By adopting a **monorepo** approach, the Rahat Platform simplifies dependency management, version control, and integration testing across multiple projects. This method not only encourages collaboration among teams but also reduces friction when integrating new features or making updates, ultimately ensuring faster iteration cycles and improved project outcomes.

This structured yet flexible environment is designed to meet the evolving needs of humanitarian aid projects, ensuring that Rahat continues to scale and adapt as new features, regulations, and technologies emerge.
