Within each project, you can access the **Project Dashboard** to get an overview of key information and progress.  
The navigation bar at the top of the project interface allows you to explore various sections, including:

- **Dashboard**
- **Beneficiaries**
- **Stakeholders**
- **Forecast Sources**
- **Trigger Statements**
- **Fund Management**
- **Payout**
- **Activities**
- **Communication Logs**

These sections help you manage different components of the project, from tracking beneficiaries and stakeholders to managing funds, monitoring triggers, viewing forecasts, and logging communications.

## Project Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries assigned to a specific project can be viewed within that project's details. However, personally identifiable information (PII) of the beneficiaries is not displayed to ensure privacy. In the **Project Beneficiaries** section, you can view both the list of individual beneficiaries and the list of beneficiary groups associated with the project.

## Stakeholders

You can view a list of stakeholders and stakeholder groups within the **Stakeholders** section. To add stakeholders, click the **Add Stakeholders** button. If you prefer to import stakeholders in bulk, click the **Import Stakeholders** button. You can download the provided Excel template, fill in the required stakeholder details, and re-upload the file to add them to the system.
