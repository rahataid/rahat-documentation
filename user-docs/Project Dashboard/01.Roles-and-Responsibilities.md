![AA Project Dashboard](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/aa-project-dashboard.png)

Within each project, you can access the **Project Dashboard** to get an overview of key information and progress.  
The navigation bar at the top of the project interface allows you to explore various sections, including:

- **Dashboard**
- **Beneficiaries**
- **Stakeholders**
- **Forecast Sources**
- **Trigger Statements**
- **Fund Management**
- **Payout**
- **Activities**
- **Communication Logs**

These sections help you manage different components of the project, from tracking beneficiaries and stakeholders to managing funds, monitoring triggers, viewing forecasts, and logging communications.

## Project Beneficiaries

![Project Beneficiary Groups](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/aa-project-beneficiary-2.png)

The beneficiaries assigned to a specific project can be viewed within that project's details. However, personally identifiable information (PII) of the beneficiaries is not displayed to ensure privacy. In the **Project Beneficiaries** section, you can view both the list of individual beneficiaries and the list of beneficiary groups associated with the project.

## Stakeholders

You can view a list of stakeholders and stakeholder groups within the **Stakeholders** section. To add stakeholders, click the **Add Stakeholders** button. If you prefer to import stakeholders in bulk, click the **Import Stakeholders** button. You can download the provided Excel template, fill in the required stakeholder details, and re-upload the file to add them to the system.

Alternatively, you can add stakeholders individually by going to **Create Stakeholder** and filling in the necessary information. All added stakeholders will be visible in the **Stakeholder List**.

![Manual Trigger Statement](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/trigger-4.png)

For the **Manual Trigger Statements**, you can add the **Title** of the trigger and the **Details** of the trigger.

![Trigger Configuration](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/trigger-5.png)

You can select **Optional** to choose if the trigger statement is optional. Likewise, you can configure trigger statements in **Manage Threshold**. Once you click on **Confirm**, you can either **Save** or **Add Another Trigger**.

If you save the trigger statements, you can view them in the **Phase Detail** page.

![Manual Trigger Detail Page](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/trigger-7.png)

In case of an **Automated Trigger**, the triggers will be activated automatically. Likewise, for **Manual Trigger Statements**, you can select the trigger statement and view the **Detail Page**.

## Manage Threshold

To manage the threshold, go to the **Phase detail** page in trigger statements and click on **Manage Threshold**.

![Manage Threshold Step 1](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/manage1.png)

You can add the numbers of **Mandatory** and **Optional** triggers and configure them. That means for the phase to be triggered, it will require *x* numbers of Mandatory trigger statements and *x* numbers of Optional trigger statements.

![Manage Threshold Step 2](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/manage-2.png)

## Activities

To manage activities, go to the **Activities** page. Here, you can add new activities and view existing ones categorized under the three phases: **Preparedness**, **Readiness**, and **Activation**. Each phase can be expanded to reveal a list of the activities associated with it.

![Activity Image 1](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-1.png)

![Activity Image 2](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-2.png)

To add a new trigger-based activity, click on **Add Activity** and complete the form. If you want the activity to be automatically triggered during the Readiness or Activation phases, check the **“Automate Activity?”** box. Enabling this option ensures that the activity is completed automatically when the relevant phase is activated, and any linked communications are sent automatically.

![Activity Image 3](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-3.png)

![Activity Image 4](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-4.png)

You can also add communications to an activity by clicking on the **Add Communication** button. In the communication form, you'll be required to select a **Communication Type** and a **Group Type**, which can be either *Stakeholder* or *Beneficiary*. The list of groups already assigned to the project will appear for selection. Depending on the communication type, you can upload or enter messages accordingly—for example, text for SMS or an MP3 file for a Voice Message. Multiple communications can be added, and a preview of them will appear below the form.

![Activity Image 5](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-5.png)

![Activity Image 6](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-6.png)

Once the activity is created, it will appear under the phase section you selected during its creation. To update the status of an activity, you can click on **Update Status** or navigate to the activity’s **Detail Page** by clicking on the activity card. While updating the status, you can also upload relevant documents and add notes, which will later be visible on the detail page.

![Activity Image 9](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/activity-9.png)
