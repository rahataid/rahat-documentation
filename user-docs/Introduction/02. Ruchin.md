We are addressing the systemic issue of delayed and reactive disaster assistance in the United States, particularly for communities most at risk. Despite over $170 million invested in forecasting technologies, 90% of disaster funding from U.S. foundations is allocated after disasters occur, not before. This delay severely impacts low-income, undocumented, elderly, and rural populations—groups that often cannot evacuate or prepare in time. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, basic relief took 3–5 days to arrive, and after Hurricane Harvey, some families waited nearly two months for federal aid.

The root of this problem lies in the absence of mechanisms to trigger financial assistance based on early warning data. Although the U.S. has some of the most advanced forecasting systems globally, these are rarely linked to anticipatory funding models. Globally, however, anticipatory action systems in 45 countries have reached over 17 million people with pre-disaster support, proving the model’s effectiveness.

Our solution directly tackles this gap by enabling early, data-driven cash or voucher disbursements. We focus on integrating early warnings with financial response to reduce harm, preserve dignity, and improve outcomes for the most vulnerable—turning forecasts into timely action.
