## User Journey: Admin / Project Manager

### 1. Logging In and Accessing the Dashboard
The Admin begins their day by securely logging into the Rahat platform using their registered credentials and a One-Time Password (OTP). Once authenticated, they are greeted with a personalized dashboard tailored to their role.  
This dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of project health, displaying key metrics such as:
- Active projects  
- Disbursement progress  
- Recent alerts  
- Pending trigger actions  
- Total number of beneficiaries across interventions  

It serves as the central hub for monitoring all ongoing activities.

### 2. Managing Users and Roles
From the navigation panel, the Admin enters the **User Management** module to manage the project team. New members—such as field staff, data analysts, and communication officers—are onboarded here.  
Each is assigned a predefined role with the appropriate level of access.  

The platform’s role-based access control ensures:
- Every user can only view and manage tools relevant to their responsibilities  
- Security and efficiency in team collaboration  

### 3. Accessing and Updating Projects
After configuring user access, the Admin navigates to the **Projects** section to review ongoing initiatives.  
Within each project, they can:
- Explore detailed records  
- Update crisis triggers, stakeholder lists, beneficiary groups, and timelines  
- Assign specific users to oversee tasks and activities  

Any updates made are instantly reflected on the main dashboard, ensuring **real-time visibility** and seamless coordination.

### 4. Project Setup
The Project Admin:
1. Logs into the Rahat Dashboard  
2. Creates a new project  
3. Selects the blockchain network (*Ethereum, Polygon, or Celo*)  
4. Sets up a treasury source:  
   - Project contract  
   - Connected wallet  
   - Multisignature Gnosis Safe (for added security)  

Once configured, the project is ready to receive and distribute funds.

### 5. Beneficiary Onboarding
The **Beneficiary Manager**:
- Imports and verifies beneficiary data using the Beneficiary Management Tool or dashboard  
- Confirms wallet addresses via SMS or web link  
- Groups beneficiaries by criteria such as location or vulnerability  

### 6. Disbursement of USDC
With beneficiaries onboarded, the Admin initiates disbursement either individually or in bulk:
- Choose the treasury source  
- Enter the amount  
- Confirm the transaction  

For **multisig wallets**, multiple signers must approve the request before USDC is released.  
Once approved, a confirmation message is sent to beneficiary wallets.

### 7. Offramping
Beneficiaries who wish to cash out:
1. Receive a link to the **Rahat Offramping Portal**  
2. Select a provider (e.g., **Kotani Pay**)  
3. Enter their mobile money details  
4. Transfer USDC to the given wallet address  

Once processed, the equivalent amount is delivered in **local currency or mobile money**.

### 8. Communication and Support
The **Rahat Communication Tool** sends:
- SMS or IVR messages to beneficiaries about fund disbursements and usage instructions  

If issues arise, beneficiaries can use the **grievance feature**, ensuring:
- Transparency  
- Quick responses  
- Trust in the aid distribution process
