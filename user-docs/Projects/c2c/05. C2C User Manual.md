## 🏗️ Project Setup

:::info
Before you can begin sending USDC (crypto aid) to your beneficiaries, the project needs to be properly configured. This involves selecting the blockchain network and setting up your treasury.
:::

### Step 1: 🔶 Choose the Blockchain Network

Each project must run on a blockchain. Rahat supports EVM-based networks such as:

#### Supported Networks

| Network | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Ethereum** | Main network | Primary blockchain network |
| **Polygon** | Layer 2 solution | Faster and cheaper transactions |
| **Celo** | Mobile-first | Optimized for mobile usage |

:::warning Important
This defines where your smart contracts live and where funds will be sent from.
:::

### Step 2: 🔐 Set Up Gnosis Safe Wallet (If Using Multisig)

If your project uses multi-signature approval for fund disbursement (highly recommended for accountability), you will need a Gnosis Safe wallet.

#### Multi-Signature Benefits

- ✅ Enhanced security through multiple approvals
- ✅ Transparent decision-making process
- ✅ Reduced risk of unauthorized transactions
- ✅ Audit trail for all disbursements

#### Example Use Case

A Gnosis Safe wallet requires multiple people (signers) to approve each transaction before funds are sent. For example: 2 out of 3 people must approve before the system sends USDC.

:::tip Technical Setup
This setup is done from the backend by the technical team. [Click here to see how to configure Gnosis Safe wallet](#multisig-disbursement)

## 💸 Disbursing USDC to Beneficiaries

Once your project is set up and beneficiaries are ready, you can start disbursing aid.

### ✅ Pre-Disbursement Checklist

Make sure:

- ✅ All intended beneficiaries are imported into the system
- ✅ If disbursing in bulk, beneficiaries are grouped properly (e.g., by location or batch)
- ✅ Project setup is complete, including treasury source configuration
- ✅ Wallet addresses are verified and validated

### 🎯 How to Disburse USDC

#### 🔹 For Individual Disbursement

1. **Navigate to Beneficiaries** - Go to the Beneficiaries section from the sidebar
2. **Select Beneficiary** - Select the specific beneficiary you want to send funds to
3. **Click Disburse** - Initiate the disbursement process

#### 🔹 Treasury Source Options

You will see 3 Treasury Source Options. Each option is a way to send money. Choose one based on where the funds are coming from:

![Treasury Source](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/treasury-source.png)

##### 1. Project Balance

- Funds are held in a project-specific smart contract
- This contract must already be funded with USDC
- USDC is sent directly to the beneficiary from the smart contract

[📎See how to fund your project contract](#-disbursement-via-multisig--detailed-steps)

##### 2. User Wallet

- Sends USDC directly from your connected wallet (like MetaMask)
- You must have USDC in your wallet
- You will be asked to connect your wallet before proceeding

##### 3. Multisig Wallet (Gnosis Safe) - **Recommended**

- Ideal for teams that want extra security and transparency
- Disbursement must be approved by multiple people before it goes through
- Funds are stored in a Gnosis Safe
