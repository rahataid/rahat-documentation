# User Roles

### Admin

Admins have full access and control over the platform’s functionalities. They can assign tokens, manage activity checklists and communications (including sending communication messages), and view communication log details. Admins are responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) trigger statements, and they have the ability to trigger and revert phases. They also manage thresholds, import beneficiary groups, and assign them to projects. Additionally, Admins can view non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data of beneficiaries, generate comprehensive and filtered reports, and manage daily monitoring and data sources. They handle fund management, payouts, and oversee stakeholders and stakeholder groups. Admins are authorized to approve vendors, define the purpose of beneficiary groups, and initiate the vendor redemption process. They also have access to view the project dashboard and manage application users.

### Manager

Managers are responsible for overseeing operational activities within the project. They can manage activity checklists and create communications through SMS or voice. They can send communication messages and view communication log details. Managers have access to beneficiary lists and non-PII data of beneficiaries in the project. They are able to generate and filter reports, view fund management and payout details, and monitor daily data sources. Additionally, they can access the trigger statement page, manage stakeholders and stakeholder groups, view the project dashboard, and access application user information, though with more limited permissions compared to Admins.

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access across the platform. They can view activity lists, transaction details, and non-PII data of beneficiaries in the project. Additionally, they can access communication details, communication log details, and both reports and filtered reports. Viewers are also able to see data sources, daily monitoring details, and the Trigger Statement page. They have access to view fund management, payout details, stakeholders and stakeholder groups, the project dashboard, and application users. Their role is strictly observational, with no permissions to modify any data or system configurations.

### Vendor

Vendors play a crucial role in the delivery of assistance by redeeming cash or in-kind funds to beneficiaries. They act as distribution points where beneficiaries can access the support allocated to them under CVA (Cash and Voucher Assistance) projects.

### Beneficiary

Beneficiaries are the end recipients of aid within the AA system. They receive communications and information related to CVA projects through SMS or IVR (Interactive Voice Response). In addition, they receive the actual assistance—either in the form of cash or in-kind support—based on their eligibility and project allocations.
