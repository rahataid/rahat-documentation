## User Journey: Admin / Project Manager

### 1. Logging In and Accessing the Dashboard

The Admin begins their day by securely logging into the Rahat AA platform using their credentials and a One-Time Password (OTP). Once authenticated, they are greeted with a personalized dashboard tailored to their role. This dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of project health, displaying metrics such as active projects, disbursement progress, recent alerts, pending trigger actions, and the total number of beneficiaries across interventions.

### 2. Managing Users and Roles

From the navigation panel, the Admin enters the User Management module. Here, they onboard new team members—field staff, data analysts, communication officers—by assigning them predefined roles with appropriate permissions. The platform’s role-based access control automatically enforces security, ensuring each user can only access tools relevant to their responsibilities.

### 3. Accessing and Updating Projects

Next, the Admin navigates to the Projects section to review ongoing initiatives. Within each project, they explore detailed records, update components like crisis triggers, stakeholder lists, beneficiary groups, and timelines. They assign specific users to manage activities and oversee execution. Any change made is instantly reflected in the main dashboard for seamless project tracking.

### 4. Configuring Forecast Sources

To prepare for anticipatory action, the Admin opens the Forecast Sources module. They integrate real-time and historical data streams from hydrometeorological sources such as DHM, GLoFAS, or NCWRM. This data becomes the foundation for setting early warning thresholds and refining predictive accuracy.

### 5. Trigger Setup and Management

In the Trigger Module, the Admin configures both automated and manual triggers:

- **Automated Triggers:** Forecasting data is linked directly, and thresholds (e.g., rainfall exceeding 100mm) are defined.  
- **Manual Triggers:** Human-validated observation statements are added as fallback mechanisms.

Once configured, these triggers are securely stored on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparent auditing. The platform constantly monitors these triggers in the background.

### 6. Planning and Monitoring Activities

The Admin shifts to the Activity Management interface, where they plan pre-crisis and post-crisis interventions. They schedule tasks like mock drills, training sessions, relief distribution, and awareness campaigns. Tasks are assigned to specific users, and the activity timeline is visualized in a Gantt chart with real-time status indicators—planned, ongoing, or completed.

### 7. Importing and Managing Beneficiaries

Using the Beneficiary Management module, the Admin links the platform to the Community Tool API. Non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) beneficiary data is securely imported, verified, and categorized. These beneficiary groups are then mapped to relevant projects, enabling targeted planning for aid and resource distribution.

### 8. Fund Management and Token Disbursement

The Admin then enters the Fund Management section to allocate digital tokens to beneficiary groups. Token values are pre-assigned and reserved in the system. When a trigger is activated, disbursements are initiated automatically, with vendors notified in advance to prepare for redemptions.

### 9. Communication and Outreach

To keep all stakeholders informed, the Admin drafts and schedules outreach campaigns from the Activities Module. SMS, IVR, or voice alerts are customized by ward, project activity, or beneficiary group. If a trigger is activated, the communication system automatically notifies recipients to ensure timely action.

### 10. Trigger Activation

When thresholds are met—either by automatic monitoring or field confirmation—the platform activates a trigger:

- **Automated Triggers:** The system detects a threshold breach and activates the trigger.  
- **Manual Triggers:** Human inputs confirm conditions and activate the trigger.

The Admin receives an instant notification, reviews logs and source data, and monitors the execution of linked activities and token disbursements.

### 11. Executing Payouts

Once a trigger is live, the Admin moves to the Payout Module to initiate fund transfers. They select the relevant beneficiary group and choose a preferred Financial Service Provider (e.g., Connect IPS, Stellar network, or another integrated FSP). The system processes the disbursement, tracks transaction statuses in real-time, and flags any errors for immediate resolution.

### 12. Monitoring and Reporting

For accountability and continuous improvement, the Admin visits the Reports Section. They generate filtered reports by date, project, location, or activity type. Visual dashboards provide insights into disbursement completion, beneficiary reach, and the effectiveness of anticipatory actions through real-time charts and tables.

### 13. Offline Sync and Field Updates

In the field, mobile teams use the app in offline mode. When they regain connectivity, their data—activity updates, media files, and trigger configurations—syncs automatically with the central system. The Admin receives a sync notification, reviews field updates, and makes adjustments to ongoing plans based on ground-level insights.
