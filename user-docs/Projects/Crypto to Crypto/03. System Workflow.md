# System Workflow

The Crypto-to-Crypto (C2C) workflow illustrates how funds move securely from **donors to beneficiaries** using the Rahat platform.  It highlights every step in the journey, from project setup and funding allocation to beneficiary notification and offramping into local currency.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Beneficiary Onboarding**  
   Beneficiaries are enrolled into the system through the Beneficiary Management Tool.  
   
2. **Funding Allocation**  
   Donor agencies send stablecoins (e.g., USDC) into the projectâ€™s **Gnosis Multisig Wallet**.  

3. **Transaction Approval & Execution**  
   Transactions are reviewed and approved by designated wallet executors/owners, ensuring secure fund movement.  

4. **Disbursement to Beneficiaries**  
   The Rahat platform executes the transaction, transferring tokens from the multisig wallet to verified beneficiary wallets.  

5. **Notifications**  
   The Communication Service sends SMS or email alerts to beneficiaries about fund disbursements.  

6. **Beneficiary Access**  
   Beneficiaries receive tokens in their digital wallets, which they fully control.  

7. **Offramping Option**  
   Through the Rahat Offramping Service, beneficiaries can choose providers (e.g., Kotani Pay) to convert tokens into fiat.  

8. **Cash-Out**  
   Funds are off-ramped into **local currency** (via mobile money or bank accounts), ensuring usability in daily life.
