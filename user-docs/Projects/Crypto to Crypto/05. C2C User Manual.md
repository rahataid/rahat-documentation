When you log into the Rahat Dashboard and open a specific project, the **Project Dashboard** provides an at-a-glance overview of all key details and progress.  

### Navigation Menu

The left-hand navigation menu includes the following options:  
- **Dashboard**  
- **Beneficiaries**  
- **Transactions**  
- **Fund Management**  
- **Communications**  
- **Grievance**  
- **Disbursement**  
- **Deposit Token**  
- **Edit Project**  

These sections allow you to:  
- Manage beneficiaries  
- Allocate and disburse funds

### Main Dashboard View

The main dashboard view displays important project information, including:  
- Charts showing **gender and age distribution** among beneficiaries  
- **Recent transactions**  
- Methods of **disbursement** being used  

This makes it easier for project managers and administrators to quickly assess the projectâ€™s overall status and activity.

## Project Setup

Before you can begin sending **USDC (crypto aid)** to beneficiaries, the project must be configured correctly. This setup ensures that funds are stored securely and can be disbursed according to the projectâ€™s rules. The first step is to choose the **blockchain network** where the project will operate. Rahat supports multiple **EVM-based networks**, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Celo. The network you choose will determine where your **smart contracts** are deployed and from where **funds** will be distributed. If your project requires **multi-signature approval** for disbursements, you must set up a **Gnosis Safe wallet**. Using a Gnosis Safe is highly recommended because it provides additional security and accountability by requiring multiple authorized people (**signers**) to approve transactions before funds are released. For instance, you can configure a rule that requires two out of three designated signers to approve before USDC is sent. This setup helps safeguard against misuse and ensures transparency in fund management. The configuration of the Gnosis Safe wallet is handled by the **technical team** on the backend, and once it has been set up, it becomes available in the **treasury source options** for disbursement. 

# Disbursing USDC to Beneficiaries

Once your project is fully set up and beneficiaries have been onboarded, you can begin the process of disbursing **USDC**. This section will guide you through the steps, options, and considerations for disbursement.

## Pre-Disbursement Checklist

Before starting the disbursement, you should confirm that all intended beneficiaries have already been imported into the system and that their wallet addresses are verified. If you are planning to disburse in bulk, make sure that the beneficiaries are grouped correctly, for example by location, gender, or project batch. The project setup should also be complete, including the funding of the chosen treasury source with enough USDC to cover the transfer.

## How to Disburse USDC

You can disburse funds either individually or in bulk. For an individual disbursement, go to the **Beneficiaries** section on the sidebar, select the specific beneficiary you want to send funds to, and click the **Disburse** button. The system will then ask you to choose a treasury source for the transaction.

## Treasury Source Options

When initiating disbursement, you must select one of three available treasury sources.

![Treasury Source](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/treasury-source.png)

- **Project Balance** â€“ Disbursement is executed from a project-specific smart contract. This contract must already be funded with USDC. Once selected, the system automatically sends the funds to the beneficiary directly from this contract.  
- **User Wallet** â€“ Funds are sent directly from your connected wallet, such as MetaMask. You must already have USDC in your wallet and will be prompted to connect it before the disbursement can proceed.  
- **Multisig Wallet (Gnosis Safe)** â€“ Used when teams want added security and accountability. The disbursement requires multiple approvals from authorized signers. Funds are only released once the required number of approvals has been reached.

## Disbursement via Project Balance

To use the **Project Balance** method, you must first load funds into the project contract. This is done by navigating to the **Fund Management** section. From there, you can either copy the project contract address and transfer funds from your wallet or scan the QR code displayed on the dashboard to complete the transfer. Once the balance has been loaded, you can initiate the disbursement by selecting Project Balance as your treasury source, entering the amount of USDC to distribute, and confirming the transaction.

## Disbursement via Multisig Wallet

When disbursing through a **Multisig Wallet**, begin by selecting the Multisig option as your treasury source and entering the amount of USDC you wish to distribute per beneficiary. The platform will then create a transaction request and forward it to the Gnosis Safe dashboard. The Safe signers will receive notifications in their Safe Wallet dashboards, and once the required number of signers approve the transaction, it becomes ready for execution. At this stage, return to the **Disbursement** section, review the transaction details, and click the **Execute** button. The system will then automatically transfer the funds to each beneficiaryâ€™s wallet.

## Beneficiary Notifications

Once the disbursement has been completed, beneficiaries will receive a notification message on their registered mobile numbers. This message confirms the amount of USDC transferred and provides guidance on how the funds can be accessed or used. Please note that the exact notification link and format may vary depending on the

# Offramping via Rahat Offramping Service

Beneficiaries who have received **USDC** through the Rahat platform can easily convert their digital tokens into local currency or mobile money using the **Rahat Offramping Service**. This service provides a secure and user-friendly way for beneficiaries to cash out their digital aid into a format they can immediately use.

## How to Start Offramping

Beneficiaries will receive a notification either by email or SMS with a personalized link to begin the offramping process. A sample message might include text along with a clickable link that directs them to the **Rahat Offramping Portal**.  

![Disbursement Message](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/disbursment-message-.png)

By clicking on the provided link, beneficiaries are redirected to the secure **Rahat Offramping Portal**, where they can complete the necessary steps to convert their USDC into fiat or mobile money.  

![Rahat Offramping Portal](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/crypto-offramp.png)

## Beneficiary Experience

Once inside the portal, beneficiaries are guided through a step-by-step process that ensures their offramping request is handled correctly. They may need to verify certain details such as their phone number, payment preference, or consent form depending on the requirements of the offramping partner (for example, Kotani Pay). After submission, the request is processed and the equivalent value of USDC is transferred into their mobile money account or local fiat wallet.

## Tracking Offramping Transactions (for Admins)

Every offramping activity carried out through the Rahat Offramping Service is automatically recorded and made visible to project administrators. To review these transactions, an admin must log in to the **Rahat Dashboard** and open the **C2C project dashboard**. From there, navigate to the **Transactions** section and select the **Offramping Transaction** tab.

In this view, admins will see detailed information for each transaction, including:  
- Beneficiaryâ€™s name  
- Amount of USDC converted  
- Fiat amount received  
- Blockchain used  
- Current transaction status  
- Timestamp  

This allows the admin team to track progress, resolve any issues, and maintain a transparent record of all conversions.

## Offramping USDC from Rahat

### Overview

The Rahat **Crypto Offramping Module** allows beneficiaries to convert their received USDC into local mobile money or fiat currency through integrated third-party services. Rahat is designed to be flexible, integrating with multiple offramping providers, such as Kotani Pay, Transak, on/off-ramp aggregators, and mobile wallet APIs. Each provider may have its own unique flow, supported networks, and compliance requirements. This guide focuses specifically on **offramping USDC using Kotani Pay**.

Navigate to the **Crypto Offramp** section in the Rahat portal and select **Kotani Pay** as your preferred provider. Kotani Pay supports cash-outs into mobile money services such as M-PESA and MTN, with options in both KES and USD.
