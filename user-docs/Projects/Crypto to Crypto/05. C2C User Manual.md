When you log into the Rahat Dashboard and open a specific project, the **Project Dashboard** provides an at-a-glance overview of all key details and progress.

### Navigation Menu

The left-hand navigation menu includes the following options:

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview and key metrics |
| **Beneficiaries** | Manage beneficiary data |
| **Transactions** | View transaction history |
| **Fund Management** | Manage project funds |
| **Communications** | Send SMS notifications |
| **Grievance** | Handle complaints and issues |
| **Disbursement** | Distribute funds to beneficiaries |
| **Deposit Token** | Add funds to project |
| **Edit Project** | Modify project settings |

These sections allow you to manage beneficiaries, allocate and disburse funds, send notifications via SMS and monitor project performance.

### Main Dashboard View

The main dashboard view displays important project information, including:

- **Charts showing gender and age distribution** among beneficiaries

## Project Setup

Before you can begin sending USDC (crypto aid) to your beneficiaries, the project needs to be properly configured. This involves selecting the blockchain network and setting up your treasury (where your funds are stored).

### üî∂ Step 1: Choose the Blockchain Network

Each project must run on a blockchain. Rahat supports EVM-based networks such as:

| Network | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ethereum** | Mainnet for production deployments |
| **Polygon** | Layer 2 solution for lower fees |
| **Celo** | Mobile-first blockchain platform |

This defines where your smart contracts live and where funds will be sent from.

### üîê Step 2: Set Up Gnosis Safe Wallet (If Using Multisig)

If your project uses multi-signature approval for fund disbursement (highly recommended for accountability), you will need a Gnosis Safe wallet.

A Gnosis Safe wallet requires multiple people (signers) to approve each transaction before funds are sent. For example: 2 out of 3 people must approve before the system sends USDC.

‚öôÔ∏è This setup is done from the backend by the technical team.

# Disbursing USDC to Beneficiaries

Once your project is fully set up and beneficiaries have been onboarded, you can begin the process of disbursing **USDC**. This section will guide you through the steps, options, and considerations for disbursement.

Once your project is set up and beneficiaries are ready, you can start disbursing aid.

## Pre-Disbursement Checklist

Make sure:

- ‚úÖ All intended beneficiaries are imported into the system
- ‚úÖ If you're disbursing in bulk, they are grouped properly (e.g., by location or batch)
- ‚úÖ The project setup is complete, including the treasury source and verification of wallet addresses

## How to Disburse USDC
![BeneficiaryList](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.31.26-pm.png)

You can disburse funds either individually or in bulk. For an individual disbursement, go to the **Beneficiaries** section on the sidebar, select the specific beneficiary you want to send funds to, and click the **Disburse** button. The system will then ask you to choose a treasury source for the transaction.

## Treasury Source Options

When initiating disbursement, you must select one of three available treasury sources.

![Treasury Source](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/treasury-source.png)

| Treasury Source | Description | Use Case |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Project Balance** | Disbursement is executed from a project-specific smart contract. This contract must already be funded with USDC. Once selected, the system automatically sends the funds to the beneficiary directly from this contract. | Standard project operations |
| **User Wallet** | Funds are sent directly from your connected wallet, such as MetaMask. You must already have USDC in your wallet and will be prompted to connect it before the disbursement can proceed. | Quick individual transfers |
| **Multisig Wallet (Gnosis Safe)** | Used when teams want added security and accountability. The disbursement requires multiple approvals from authorized signers. Funds are only released once the required number of approvals has been reached. | High-security operations |

---

## Disbursement via Project Balance
![Fund Disburse](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/fund-managment-.png)

To use the **Project Balance** method, you must first load funds into the project contract. This is done by navigating to the **Fund Management** section. From there, you can either copy the project contract address and transfer funds from your wallet or scan the QR code displayed on the dashboard to complete the transfer.

Once the balance has been loaded, you can initiate the disbursement by selecting Project Balance as your treasury source, entering the amount of USDC to distribute, and confirming the transaction.

## Disbursement via Multisig Wallet

![Multisig](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.34.51-pm.png)
When disbursing through a **Multisig Wallet**, begin by selecting the Multisig option as your treasury source and entering the amount of USDC you wish to distribute per beneficiary.

![Multisig Disbursement Step 1](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.35.23-pm.png)

![Multisig Disbursement Step 2](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.35.48-pm.png)

The platform will then create a transaction request and forward it to the Gnosis Safe dashboard. The Safe signers will receive notifications in their Safe Wallet dashboards, and once the required number of signers approve the transaction, it becomes ready for execution.

![Gnosis Safe Dashboard](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.37.26-pm.png)

At this stage, return to the **Disbursement** section, review the transaction details, and click the **Execute** button. The system will then automatically transfer the funds to each beneficiary's wallet.

## Beneficiary Notifications
![Disbursement Message](https://assets.rumsan.net/rahat/disbursment-message-.png)
Once the disbursement has been completed, beneficiaries will receive a notification message on their registered mobile numbers. This message confirms the amount of USDC transferred and provides guidance on how the funds can be accessed or used. Please note that the exact notification link and format may vary depending on the

## Offramping USDC from Rahat

### Overview

The Rahat **Crypto Offramping Module** allows beneficiaries to convert their received USDC into local mobile money or fiat currency through integrated third-party services. Rahat is designed to be flexible, integrating with multiple offramping providers, such as Kotani Pay, Transak, on/off-ramp aggregators, and mobile wallet APIs. Each provider may have its own unique flow, supported networks, and compliance requirements. This guide focuses specifically on **offramping USDC using Kotani Pay**.

### How to Offramp USDC via Kotani Pay

#### Step 1: Select an Offramping Provider

Navigate to the **Crypto Offramp** section in the Rahat portal and select **Kotani Pay** as your preferred provider. Kotani Pay supports cash-outs into mobile money services such as M-PESA and MTN, with options in both KES and USD.
